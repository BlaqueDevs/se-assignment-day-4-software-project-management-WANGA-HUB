## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
1. Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next whereas agile uses an iterative and incremental approach where the project is divided into small cycles that deliver working software at each stage.
2. Waterfall is rigid and less adaptable to changes whereas agile is highly flexible and changes can be made at every phase.
3. In waterfall the product is delivered at the end of the project after all phases are completed whereas in agile the working increments of the product are released at the end of each sprint.
4. For waterfall, clients provide input mainly at the beginning and the end of the project whereas in agile clients are actively involved throughout the entire process.
5. There are higher risks in waterfall than in agile since there is continuous testing and feedbackallow early identification and resolutions of problems.
   ADVANTAGES OF AGILE METHODOLOGY;
   1. It is flexible as it allows changes and improvements throughout the development cycle.
   2. It ensures customer collaboration which allows the final product meets user expectations.
   3. It allows better risk management since problems are identified and resolved early.

   DISADVANTAGES OF AGILE METHODOLOGY;
   1. Changing requirements can make project scope and timeline unclear.
   2. It needs strong coordination and decision-making skills for the projects.
   3. Scaling agile across large teams and complex systems can be challenging.
   4. Less emphasis on documentation may lead to knowledge gaps if team members leave.
   ADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL;
   1. Each phase is well-defined making the project management easier.
   2. Since all requirements are set upfront, cost and deadlines are easier to estimate.
   3. Its extensive documentation helps maintain clarity and continuity.
   4. It is ideal for projects where requirements are unlikely to change.
   DISADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL;
   1. Any change in requirements after the project starts is difficult and costly.
   2. Bugs and usability issues are often discovered late, making fixes expensive.
   3. If a problem arises late in development, the whole project may be delayed or fail.
   4. Clients have little involvement after the initial planning phases, which may result in a product that does not fully meet their needs.    
      
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
AGILE IS MORE BENEFICIAL FOR PROJECTS THAT;

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
HOW PROJECT SCOPE CONTRIBUTE TO SUCCESSFUL PROJECT PLANNING;
1. It provides clear objectives and goals by ensuring everyone understands what the project is about and what needs to be achieved.
2. It prevents scope creep which happens when uncontrolled changes or additions occur leading to delays and increased costs.
3. It improves resource allocation by estimating the required resources accurately.
4. It enhances time and cost management which leads to better scheduling and budgeting.
5. It defines responsibilities and roles hence reducing confusion and overlapping responsibilities.
   Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchial decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable components.
   It is useful in that;
   1. It improves project organization and clarity by helping teams understand what needs to be done at each stage.
   2. It enhances task assignment and accountability by clearly defining who is responsible for each task.
